R cripts were developed and used for the paper Knytl et al (in preparation), entitled 'XXX'

Statistics of borealis karyotype is based on length of chromosomal arms. Measured values were added to Google sheets (line number, chromosome, p, q, relative length, p/q arm ratio). Values in each Google Sheets table were ordered increasingly based on chromosome type (Data -> Sort range -> Advanced range sorting options -> Sort by Column B (chromosome), A to Z).

New Google Sheet 'final XBO chromosomal length and p-q arm ratio' was made using 'file - make a copy'. In the new sheet, only tables with names of each column were created. Each table of measurements was downloaded as Tab Separated Values (.tsv) to the 'chromosome_measurement' directory.
